# :bar_chart: Custom Reporting Overview

Custom reporting in Fast-Weigh is powered by [Data Queries](/data-queries/overview).

There are 3 officially supported custom reporting solutions:

- [Embedded Telerik Reports](/custom-reporting/telerik)
- [Excel Workbooks](/custom-reporting/excel)
- [Power BI](/customer-reporting/power-bi)

You may, of course, use Data Queries as the datasource for any third party reporting solution you'd like. But please note that we can only provide support for the solutions above.
